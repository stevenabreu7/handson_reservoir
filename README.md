# Hands-on reservoir computing

Repository for the paper "Hands-on reservoir computing: a tutorial for practical implementation" (Neuromorphic Computing and Engineering, 2022), [link to paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4386/ac7db7/meta).

Please see the [handson_tutorial](./handson_tutorial.ipynb) notebook for a hands-on tutorial that walks through the setup, training, and optimization of a physical reservoir system, using a blackbox simulated reservoir (found in the [reservoir](./reservoir.py) Python script) as a stand-in for a physical reservoir. The tutorial uses the [Iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) which can be downloaded via the [UCI ML Repository](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) or via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris) (registration may be required). It is already available as a [CSV file](./iris.csv) in this repository.
